# Mapty

I coded this application along with the course I was studying from. It is typed in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
Some features I can point out in this project are the implementation of jQuery, D.O.M, Prototypical Inheritance and Classes.
The application works based on a Geolocation API, it requests the user's location through the browser to determine the exacts coordinates and render the specific information to the app.
