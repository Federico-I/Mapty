# Mapty

I typed the code for this application along with the course I was studying from. The languages implemented in this project are JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
Some features I can point out from this project are jQuery, D.O.M, Prototypical Inheritance and Classes among others.

The application works based on a Geolocation API, it requests the user's location through the browser to determine the exacts coordinates and render the specific information to the app. By clicking on the map the application will fetch through the API the specific geolocation to render the position using the coordinates of latitude and longitude.

The porpuse of the application is to allow the user to store running/cycling routine data as time and distance plus the geolocation on the map. After clicking on the map a form will be render on the left side of the browser with empty fields to complete with the workout information. 

There is an additional feature at the bottom right input field of the form, which will display a value depending on the type of training choosen and information inputed.
